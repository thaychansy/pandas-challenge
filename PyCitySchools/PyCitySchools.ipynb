    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Reading Scores</strong>: Charter schools seem to have an edge in reading. This analysis found that in the PyCity Schools, more Charter schools showed significant gains in reading compared to traditional District schools with similar students. </p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Math Scores</strong>: The results in math follow the same trend as the reading data where Charter schools scores are higher than District schools. </p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Overall Scores</strong>: The data suggests that Charter schools outperform District schools overall. Charter schools had a significantly higher percentage of students passing both math and reading tests at (90.43% vs 53.67%).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Budget</strong>: While District schools have a larger total budget, however the budget per student is not significantly higher than Charter schools.</p>\n",
